My name is Maxen Olvera and I’m currently in my second year at University of California, Riverside. However, school isn’t the whole thing that is in my daily rotation. I have recently become a manager at The Sub Station. The beloved sandwich shop has been around for fifty years now. I started working there in January. I have also volunteered as a camp counselor at Camp Del Corazon. Del Corazon allowed me to work with young people that had heart problems. Southern California local, Francisco “Franky” Castle, is passionate about the arts. I met Castle at Riverside’s monthly art walk. He was willing to sit down with me and tell his story. Castle was born in Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico, and left for the states at the age of three. His parents were determined to achieve the American dream in Anaheim, California. Castle’s father became a carpenter, and his mother began working at a local factory. Castle grew up in a neighborhood that served as a home for various gangs. With the gangs residing in his backyard, Castle was exposed to drugs and violence. However, the neighborhood also showed him the beauty of graffiti.
<br><br>

        Castle has always been interested in the art of graffiti as he was fascinated by the graffiti on the New York subway. Castle and a couple of friends from his neighborhood began to tag areas in Anaheim with graffiti. He slowly realized that he possessed a natural gift for painting, leading him to spray paint throughout high school. Alongside his visual artwork, Castle also found a new passion for music and performed in a band. At one of his shows, he and his band were pushed into a fight. The police were called to the situation. Castle was arrested for aggravated assault and was sentenced to six months in prison. This gave him a wake-up call in prison when an officer asked him, “Why are you even here?” Castle felt that his life was going in the wrong direction. Castle was soon released from confinement and aimed to find a high-paying job.

Unfortunately, Castle was turned away from every employer because of his criminal record. After mounds of rejection, Castle decided to venture into entrepreneurship. He ran three mobile phone stores within Cardenas Markets in Southern California for 17 years. In 2016, Castle started to become sick of his routine at the mobile store. He would be working day and night with zero time for a life outside of work. He sold all of his stores in late 2016 and used his money to buy a studio space. However, at this time, Castle hadn’t touched a paintbrush in 25 years.
<br><br>

     Castle isolated himself in the studio for 10 hours a day trying to paint a masterpiece. Castle felt that he needed something to enhance his art, inevitably leading him to drugs and alcohol that became his fuel for inspiration. He believed that tapping into that altered state of mind allowed him to create pieces that would astonish his audience. Castle fell into a drug-induced spiral that lasted for four years. During this time, he made art like he never had before while his body paid the price. Castle started to look disheveled and worn out. Castle says many paintings were ruined during this time because he was too intoxicated to complete the job. 

The pandemic hit and  Castle decided to get sober, as the drugs were corroding his mind and art. Castle has been sober ever since. He credits his sobriety to meditation and personal growth that came from forgiveness.
